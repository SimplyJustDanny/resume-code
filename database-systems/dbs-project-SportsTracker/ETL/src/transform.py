    # TODO: Figure out what transformation is needed.
    # TRANSFORMATIONS NEEDED (maybe):
    # 1. If there are single quotes within the texts like "child's toy", replace them with '' like "child''s toy".
    #   Why - SQL uses single quotes for strings, and when single quotes are within the strings it causes problems. Hence, the double quotes (literally, two 's) is used. The DataFrame items must be replaced with this. 

    # 2. Unsure if lines 12 and 13 from extract.py are transformations and should be placed here.  
    return x
