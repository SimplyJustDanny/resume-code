Code that was made for my CSE classes.

Advanced Programming (C++):
- advprog-project-1-AudioVisualizer: Partner VSC and OpenFrameworks project in which the goal was to develop an audio visualizer and implement features like pause, volume control, and an input record and replay feature.
- advprog-project-2-and-3-PacMan: Two-part partner VSC and OpenFrameworks project in which the goal was to design new features for a prebuilt game of Pac-Man, which included player selection, new powerups integrated via interface and inheritance, and a GPS that tracks nearby powerups in real-time.

Analysis of Algorithms (Python):
- algorithms-project-1-DNASequencingAlignment: Algorithm that created 2D arrays in order to compare, navigate and score DNA sequences for alignment.
- algorithms-project-2-EmailBloomFilters: Algorithm that creates bloom filters via bit array with given email inputs.

Artificial Intelligence (Python):
- ai-project-1-PacmanSearch: A fork of Berkeley University's CS188 Spring 2024 Project 1, which is a simulation of Pac-Man that utilized searching algorithms to find the exit. Solved up to Q4. Algorithms implemented include depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform cost search and A-star search.
- ai-project-2-FullyConnectedNeuralNetworks: Two Jupyter notebooks for regression and classification respectively. Both notebooks contain three neural networks that train with the Auto MPG and the MNIST datasets respectively.
- ai-project-3-ConvolutedNeuralNetworks: A Jupyter notebook featuring four convoluted, fully-connected neural networks designed to train and test both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

Computer Architecture (6502 ASM):
- comparch-project-NESLabyrinthGame: Solo VSC project which was to build a functional NES game from scratch using 6502 assembly language. The project was divided into multiple tasks with goals such as image processing, player movement, stage collision, and game logic. This is the final product.
- comparch-project-phases: Each individual task as originally submitted, alongside corresponding informative PowerPoints.

Data Structures (Java):
- datastructs-project-1-ContactDirectorySystem: Eclipse project which developed part of a contact directory system that suggested to the user friends of friends and compared users with similar birthdays via doubly linked lists.
- datastructs-project-2-BloomFilters: Eclipse project that produced bloom filters via bit array lists for users within a given doubly linked list.
- PascalTriangleRow [getRowPascalTriangle()]: Returns an array of the nth row of the Pascal Triangle in O(N) time.
- SudokuValidifier [isValidSudoku()]: Returns a boolean of whether or not a 2D array Sudoku is valid in O(1) time.
- TwoSums [twoSum()]: Function that finds a unique pair of ints in an array that form a target sum in O(n*log(n)) time.

Intro to Programming (Python):
- introprog-project-1-BankSim: Singlehandedly programmed a bank account simulator with proper withdrawal, deposit and exit commands, alongside QoL features like accepting dollar sign inputs and displaying transaction calculations.
- introprog-project-2-TextGame: Programmed a 1980s styled text adventure game, where you explore a house and do bizarre, comedic, and magical activities. Made to entertain players with a fun experience. Has QoL features like a built-in map and an inventory tracker.
- toRoman() and fromRoman(): Built two functions that converted Arabic to Roman numerals and vice versa respectively, both in under 50 lines of code. Both functions were used to convert two texts document containing 4000 Arabic and Roman numbers respectively, which they both did quickly.

Operating Systems (C [Linux Ubuntu]):
- os-project-1-SemaphoreSinePrograms: Made multiple programs (SineGenerator, SineAnalyzer, and SineVisualizer) that work synchronously via semaphores to generate doubles, compute their sine values, and have both be printed respectively. Documented and commented with Doxygen and coded in the style of Google.
- os-project-2-IMUDriverSimulator: Built two programs. IMUDriver periodically edits a file via timers to simulate a device driver of a robot's motion sensor. Supervisor checks if an instance of IMUDriver is still running, and, if not, creates a new one via a fork. Both documented and commented with Doxygen and coded in the style of Google.

Programming Languages (Python):
- pl-project-1-C++Lexer: Using PLY's LEX, designed a lexical analyzer that recognizes rudimentary C++ styled code, tokenizes it and prints what and where the token is. Recognizes identifiers, numbers, keywords, delimiters, and operators. Properly handles whitespaces, newlines, comments, and illegal characters.
- pl-project-2-C++Parser: Built, on top of the prior lexer, a parsing code via PLY's YACC that recognizes a rudimentary C++ context-free grammar.  Recognizes statements such as assignments, if conditionals, if-else conditionals, while loops, action statements, operation expressions, boolean expressions, let expressions, functions and structs.
