Code that was made for my CSE class.

C++:
> advprog-project-1-AudioVisualizer: Partner VSC and OpenFrameworks project in which the goal was to develop an audio visualizer and implement features like pause, volume control, and an input record and replay feature. Grade received was 96/100.
> advprog-project-2-and-3-PacMan: Two-part partnerVSC and OpenFrameworksproject in which the goal was to design new features for a prebuilt game of Pac-Man, which included player selection, new powerups integrated via interface and inheritance, and a GPS that tracks nearby powerups in real-time. First part was graded 91/100, while the second part was graded 100/100.

Java:
> datastruct-project-1-ContactDirectorySystem: Eclipse project which developed part of a contact directory system that suggested to the user friends of friends and compared users with similar birthdays via doubly linked lists. Grade received was 100/100.
> datastruct-project-2-BloomFilters: Eclipse project that produced bloom filters via bit array lists for users within a given doubly linked list. Grade received was 100/100.
> PascalTriangleRow [getRowPascalTriangle()]: Returns an array of the nth row of the Pascal Triangle in O(N) time.
> SudokuValidifier [isValidSudoku()]: Returns a boolean of whether or not a 2D array Sudoku is valid in O(1) time.
> TwoSums [twoSum()]: Function that finds a unique pair of ints in an array that form a target sum in O(n*log(n)) time.

Python:
> algorithm-project-1-DNASequencingAlignment: Algorithm that created 2D arrays in order to compare, navigate and score DNA sequences for alignment. Grade received was 100/100.
> algorithm-project-2-EmailBloomFilters: Algorithm that creates bloom filters via bit array with given email inputs. Grade received was 100/100.
> introprog-project-1-BankSim: Singlehandedly programmed a bank account simulator with proper withdrawal, deposit and exit commands, alongside QoL features like accepting dollar sign inputs and displaying transaction calculations. Grade received was 100/100.
> introprog-project-2-TextGame: Programmed a 1980s styled text adventure game, where you explore a house and do bizarre, comedic, and magical activities. Made to entertain players with a fun experience. Has QoL features like a built-in map and an inventory tracker. Grade received was 50/50.
> toRoman() and fromRoman(): Built two functions that converted Arabic to Roman numerals and vice versa respectively, both in under 50 lines of code. Both functions were used to convert two texts document containing 4000 Arabic and Roman numbers respectively, which they both did quickly.
