# resume-code
Code that was made for my CSE classes.

6502 ASM:
- architecture-project-NESLabyrinthGame: Solo VSC project which was to build a functional NES game from scratch using assembly language. The project was divided into multiple tasks with goals such as image processing, player movement, stage collision, and game logic.

C++:
- advprog-project-1-AudioVisualizer: Partner VSC and OpenFrameworks project in which the goal was to develop an audio visualizer and implement features like pause, volume control, and an input record and replay feature.
- advprog-project-2-and-3-PacMan: Two-part partner VSC and OpenFrameworks project in which the goal was to design new features for a prebuilt game of Pac-Man, which included player selection, new powerups integrated via interface and inheritance, and a GPS that tracks nearby powerups in real-time.

Java:
- datastruct-project-1-ContactDirectorySystem: Eclipse project which developed part of a contact directory system that suggested to the user friends of friends and compared users with similar birthdays via doubly linked lists.
- datastruct-project-2-BloomFilters: Eclipse project that produced bloom filters via bit array lists for users within a given doubly linked list.
- PascalTriangleRow [getRowPascalTriangle()]: Returns an array of the nth row of the Pascal Triangle in O(N) time.
- SudokuValidifier [isValidSudoku()]: Returns a boolean of whether or not a 2D array Sudoku is valid in O(1) time.
- TwoSums [twoSum()]: Function that finds a unique pair of ints in an array that form a target sum in O(n*log(n)) time.

Python:
- artificialintelligence-project-1-PacmanSearch: 
- artificialintelligence-project-2-FullyConnectedNeuralNetworks: Two python notebooks for regression and classification respectively. Both notebooks contain three neural networks that train with the Auto MPG and the MNIST datasets respectively.
- artificialintelligence-project-3-ConvolutedNeuralNetworks: A Python notebook featuring three convoluted, fully-connected neural networks designed to train and test both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.
- algorithm-project-1-DNASequencingAlignment: Algorithm that created 2D arrays in order to compare, navigate and score DNA sequences for alignment.
- algorithm-project-2-EmailBloomFilters: Algorithm that creates bloom filters via bit array with given email inputs.
- introprog-project-1-BankSim: Singlehandedly programmed a bank account simulator with proper withdrawal, deposit and exit commands, alongside QoL features like accepting dollar sign inputs and displaying transaction calculations.
- introprog-project-2-TextGame: Programmed a 1980s styled text adventure game, where you explore a house and do bizarre, comedic, and magical activities. Made to entertain players with a fun experience. Has QoL features like a built-in map and an inventory tracker.
- toRoman() and fromRoman(): Built two functions that converted Arabic to Roman numerals and vice versa respectively, both in under 50 lines of code. Both functions were used to convert two texts document containing 4000 Arabic and Roman numbers respectively, which they both did quickly.
